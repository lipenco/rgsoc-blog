This is the crisis time. JavaScript doesn't listen to me. My super-cool-brand-new-features -substeps to impress.js don't work.

Too many trials makes me nervous. Whatever it takes, I will make it to work.

### Today I Learned:
* Persistence, persistence, persistence.

_To sum up_:
Just another day with JS frustration.
