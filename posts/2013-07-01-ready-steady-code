So here I am - 150 100 900 tabs open with tutorials and articles about JavaScript and CSS3. I try to be attentive to them all - these are my mentor's recommendations.

Fortunately Bartek shears my opinion that you need to start coding to figure out that reading doesn't really makes a work done for you.

Today, on our first weekly meeting, we set our firs operational plan for the first week of Summer of Code: to provide impress.js users with css themes and imaginative html. The most challenging part will be to pretend that I understand every single line of imppress.js JavaScript code.

We also discussed if we should care about your grandfather using IE(10) or not and how can we pleased him as well. Look at my [Trello Board](https://trello.com/board/impress-js-summer-of-code/51bee39938cdf46401002f4e) to see how it is going.


### Today I Learned:
* Book ['Building Impressive Presentations with Impress.js'](http://www.amazon.com/dp/1849696489) was surprisingly interesting
* I think I finally understand how to use git to not mess up with Rubymonsters project.
* [EuroPython](https://ep2013.europython.eu/p3/live/) schedule doesn't seduce me, but I will give a try tomorrow.

_To sum up_:
Passive knowledge isn't worth my time.
