Rails Girls Summer of Code, you've been so good for me. Now it's time to move on, but my app has begin my biggest hobby. My messy code makes it hard to debug and add new features, every new functionality is a big battle. But I just love it. 

There is still so much to do.

### Today I Learned:
* Building admin page with charts and tables that represent the data base.
* Sinatra
* Mustache

_To sum up_:
I like my new internship in Tokyo, so many news stuff and frameworks to learn.
