The end of the theoretical muttering about objects and arrays came with new assignments. Though it has been difficult, step by step, I am preparing a slide position generator. This tasks seems to be as exciting as it is frustrating.

The first exercise sounds easy:
"Let's assume that the HTML for an impress.js presentation is created (all steps) but without `data-attribute`s. So steps don't have any position defined in HTML. (..) Write a script that runs before impress.init() that adds some positions to all steps. (..)."

I was jumping for happiness when my simple [for loop](https://github.com/lipenco/impress.js-myscript) worked.

I had a nice talk with my friend, an experienced developer. He tried hard to persuade me to start with Java or C#. In his opinion, JavaScript is not the right place to start: it is difficult to debug and it is hard to learn all the programming logic in the browser. "The language is not important, abstract thinking and code writing are skills you need now."

I am thinking seriously about getting back to the [CS50x](https://www.edx.org/course/harvard-university/cs50x/introduction-computer-science/1022) computer science course from Harvard that I started a long time ago and never finished. It was just too painful.


### Today I Learned:
* Thanks to Bartek I understood that impress.js is not listening to any code I am writing outside this function, which wasn't too obvious for me.
* He taught me many other things, and found out that sometimes I pretend I understand.
* How to make a CSS hovering animated effect that doesn't go back after hovering ends. [Here is a nice example.](http://jsfiddle.net/rHpDn/3/)

_To sum up_:
Success should be celebrated.
