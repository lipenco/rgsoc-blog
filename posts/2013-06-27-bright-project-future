We planned, we discussed, and now I know what I don't know, much better. We set our goal for the summer project clear and simple: make impress.js easy to use for less tech savvy `||` lazy people. I'll need to boost my CSS3 and JavaScript skills in order to achieve this goal. But the most important thing I learned from my first call with my mentor is that he is exactly the person I need and want to work with. Dedicated and willing to share his knowledge. "I don't want to limit my role as a mentor to reviewing the code and setting tasks for you, I am happy to teach you stuff," he said. Just perfect.

We are going to use a [Trello board](https://trello.com/board/impress-js-summer-of-code/51bee39938cdf46401002f4e) to manage the chaos. Feel more than welcome to spy on this stuff. Knowing you're watching will make me more ambitious even though I probably wouldn't survive working any more each day.

I planned to continue on reading my favourite bed story about the omnipotent JavaScript and [book about impress.js](http://www.amazon.com/dp/1849696489), but I just spent all my time on preparing my presentation testing out animations and sub-step features.

### Today I Learned:

* I discovered a wonderful framework: [animate.css](http://daneden.me/animate/) and a hidden gem, [impress.js - sub-steps](https://github.com/tehfoo/impress.js), that provides navigation sub-steps for presentations. I am curious what keeps Bartek from merging this code.
* jQuery documentation is the least helpful crap I have seen. 
* Being the owner of popular open source project is like a full time job â€“ judging by the number of discussion and GitHub issues Bartek to responds to.

_To sum up_:
Searching for ready to use coding solutions sux but at least I found [this!](http://pudelekx.pl/na-bahamach-jest-plaza-dla-swin-7466).
