John is right - it is better to write code 10 (100?) times slower without any help, than just ask somebody for help and get it done without any effort.

That was the case with my 'substeps'. While waiting for a call with my mentor Chris I proudly figured out the [code](https://github.com/lipenco/impress.js-substeps) on my own. Let's see if I can make a step forward with further refactoring of my layouts.

### Today I Learned:
* I think it is only now that I understand power and use of indexes.

_To sum up_:
Cannot wait for today's call with Bartek. Time for testing.
