I have summer romance with [Jasmine](http://pivotal.github.io/jasmine/) and QUnit. Writing sample test.

When I am tired I am getting back to my unsolved problem with relative steps feature.

### Today I Learned:
* Principles of testing.
* Magic of parseInt()
* Using my new toy - tablet :) Now I am fully quipped for my fron-end development with design inclinations. It is kind of distracting!
* Blessing of [JQuery WayPoints](http://imakewebthings.com/jquery-waypoints/#shortcuts-examples)

_To sum up_:
Cannot wait for my relative steps positioning to start working.
