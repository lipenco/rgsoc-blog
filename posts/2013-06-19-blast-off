Time to prepare for the Rails Girls Summer of Code. My first task was to create this blog to track my work. It seems like changing my every-day passion into a full-time routine, but as an ex-journalist I'm looking forward to some exhibitionist pleasure. It's most likely a one-sided pleasure, my dear small audience.

Rails Girls Summer of Code starts in two weeks. All the participants are supposed to keep a blog to track progress. I've seen some of them already â€“ beautiful design made in five minutes using popular services. Some people call it effectiveness, but there is such a masochistic pleasure in reinventing the wheel that I can't resist. I decided to build my hand-made blog. John believes that the only sensible choice for a developer blog is to use a static website generator. I am under constant static-website propaganda that I started to believe that a good front-end developer does not need to get her hands dirty with PHP and I gave up tha idea of creating a Wordpress theme.

[Middleman](http://middlemanapp.com), the open static website generator made it possible to build all all the blogging infrastructure on my website. I hit a roadblock when I decided to add a [Kudos](https://github.com/masukomi/kudos) feature to my posts. Kudos are definitely too "osom" (pol. awesome) to go without. This feature totally made my day, and by made my day I mean it just took all the time. Not only mine, but also John's.

jQuery was not enough for building Kudos. We needed a backend to store our Kudos and remember the  huge numbers of Kudos you all are going to give me. Since there's no way to dyanmically store data on a static website, we had to use something else. [Parse](http://parse.com) to the rescue. After painfully wading through the documentation and trying hundreds of variations of code, we made it. Ok, no-cheating -he made it, I gave up on the back end.

### Today I Learned:
* Looking at someone coding can be more tiring than coding on your own.
* Before I show any code to John I have to count and correct my messy code, we will not move forward until it's cleaned up.
* Learning by watching doesn't work, but it sure does speed up your progress.

_To sum up_: You'd better make good use of Kudos - it cost me so much time! Viciously I (we) made it so that you cannot remove your kudo in case you change your mind ;p.
