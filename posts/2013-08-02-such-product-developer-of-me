It is arguable if impress.js needs substeps for presentations for building suspense and not revealing all content at the first glance. Vox populi on GitHub said yes to substeps, Bartek said it is 'powerpoitish' and impress.js should be kept simple.

For me substeps feature is just another occasion to write my own JavaScript code and implement it with CSS animations.

You can see [my work done here.](http://lipen.co/impress.js-substeps/) with implemented event listeners for keyup.

Let's move to another task - build the script with will "play" presentation and changing slides according to data-duration attributes.


### Today I Learned:
* More about event listeners, more about switch
* And some Rails (rubymonsters in progress).

_To sum up_:
Everything has been already invented, so be happy we have everything.
