JavaScript is becoming more domesticated. I made 6 template generators, and it really seems I can contribute to impress.js and make the user's life easier. 

I had Skype a call with my mentor Chris, who shared with me his golden tip: "code like a Ninja." It means to add as little code as possible to do all the magic. It was not possible this time, as we couldn't code inside core impress.js file, but Chris quickly explained and figured out the solution without a drop of sweat. I really think it was not too easy to generate a slide template in the "snake" grid style like this:

					1st slide, 2nd slide, 3rd slide, 4th slide,
					8th slide, 7th slide, 6th slide, 5th slide,
					9th slide, 10th slide, 11th slide, 12th slide...

My [Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/Bi7XqDyM/impress-js-summer-of-code) looks like a military proving ground, my fork of [impress](https://github.com/lipenco/theme-impress/commit/77a454becafb577d176983b6af1eb59ca19a7fdb#commitcomment-3636545) like my essays form school - so many comments and corrections. If my literature teacher had had so much patience for me like Bartek I would definitely have become a literature teacher. Luck me, he was impatient. 


### Today I Learned:
* How to use nested loops to reverse slides direction.
* How to make JavaScript understand what I want.
* Small parenthesis can make you feel stupid, if you don't add them in the right place.
* Nice tools like [jsbeautifier](http://jsbeautifier.org/) and [JS Hint](http://jshint.com/).
* Watermelon has 300 kcal for 1kg. 

_To sum up_:
If I think twice, I will figure it out on the fifth attempt.
