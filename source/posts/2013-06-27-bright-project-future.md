title: Brlight project future seen in 3D
---

We planned, we discussed and now I know (what I don't know yet) better. We set our goal for the summer project clear and simple: make impress.js easy to use for less tech savvy || lazy people. The way to achieve this leads through boosting my CSS3 and JavaScript skills. But the most important thing I learnt from my first call with my mentor is that he is exactly the person I need and want to work with. Dedicated and willing to share his knowledge. "I don't want to limit my role as a mentor to reviewing the code and setting tasks for you, I am happy to teach you stuff", he said. Just perfect.

We are going to use [Trello board](https://trello.com/board/impress-js-summer-of-code/51bee39938cdf46401002f4e) for managing my chaos. Feel more than welcome to spy on this stuff. Knowing you see will make me more ambitious, though I believe one more hour daily looking at 3d objects rendering in the browser could kill me.

I panned to continue on reading my favourite bed story about omnipotent JavaScript, some other tutorials and [book about impress.js](http://www.amazon.com/dp/1849696489), but I just spent all my time on preparing my presentation testing out animations and sub-step features.

### Today I Learned:

* I discovered a wonderful framework: [animate.css](http://daneden.me/animate/) and some hidden gem for [impress.js - sub-steps](https://github.com/tehfoo/impress.js) navigation for presentation that works just prefect for me. I am curious what keeps Bartek from merging this code.
* jQuery documentation is the least helpful crap I have seen. 
* Being the owner of popular open source project is like a full time jobs - judging by the number of discussion and github issues Bartek is able to respond to and deal with.

_To sum up_:
Searching for ready to use coding solutions sux but at least i found [this!](http://pudelekx.pl/na-bahamach-jest-plaza-dla-swin-7466).
