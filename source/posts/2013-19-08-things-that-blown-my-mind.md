title: Things that blow my mind

My first JavaScript event born with a big pain. If it weren't for John's help I would have most likely miscarried. But look how beautiful it is.

   `var event = document.createEvent("CustomEvent");
    event.initCustomEvent("impress:substep:enter", true, true);
    future[0].dispatchEvent(event);`

All these to create automated presentation with my substeps, when substeps are howing up in accordance to their data-duration attribute.

Recently spend a lot of time watching my new favourite coding show: [Software as a Service on edx.org](https://courses.edx.org/accounts/login?next=/courses/BerkeleyX/CS-169.1x/2013_Summer/courseware). This is totally awesome.

I am also proud of Bettina and Meren with who I managed to launch [Speakreinen Liste](http://speakerinnen-liste.herokuapp.com/). Not without any bugs, but who cares when effects are so nice.


### Today I Learned:
* Rails, Ruby, more Java Script
* Test-driven development with Jasmine

_To sum up_:
Thinking about future work for me, how about just creating it on my own.
