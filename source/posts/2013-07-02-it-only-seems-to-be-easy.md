title: It only Looks that Simple

But is is not.
[This is what I did today](http://lipen.co/theme-impress/theme-index.html#/slide1) - work in progress of building a universal, aesthetic template for masses. 


### Today I Learned:
* I can spend 3h choosing and adjusting right images - it is kind of annoying to have too many ideas and nice pictures to choose from. 
* Photoshop is a terrible trap that coatch me and didn't want to let me out.
* EuroPython is good for everybody but people who want to learn something about front-end and open source. Even is the lecture title doesn't seem so.
* Right positioning in impress.js is kind of difficult. 


_To sum up_:
Limoncello does taste like a lemon soap, but it makes you feel so Florentine.
