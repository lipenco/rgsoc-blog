title: On Tests
---

Never was so much coded by so many to achieve so little.

Fortunately on my [to do list](https://trello.com/b/Bi7XqDyM/impress-js-summer-of-code) there are way more assignments to complete than testing. I should focus on writing script for automated animations with data-duration for each slide, animated effect for subsets, script for relative steps positioning and event listeners.


### Today I Learned:
* Solving problem in the night takes 7 times more than in the morningnext day. Mateusz insist on me to get back to coding principles. Try, how quickly you can get 10 out of [this code](http://jsbin.com/ikoveg/5/edit).

_To sum up_:
SPARTA!
