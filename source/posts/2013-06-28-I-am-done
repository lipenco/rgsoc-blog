Building a presentation with impress.js is like Disneyland - it will never be finished.
There is always something you can add or correct. But I am done with [ChallengePost](http://impressjs.challengepost.com/).
I don't want to hear about Google tax evasion any more. This gradient has burned out my eyes. Try to look as it for 9h a day for a week, you will/won't see.

Here it is, my [awesome presentation](http://lipen.co/google-tax-evasion-presentation/).

### Today I Learned:
* How to finish up the project, go out with a friend, do some voluntary work, meet up with part of RubyMonsters team to work on Speakerinnen Liste and cook a dinner in one day.

_To sum up_:
Censured
