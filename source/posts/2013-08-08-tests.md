title: Tests and distractions
---

I have summer romance with [Jasmine](http://pivotal.github.io/jasmine/) and QUnit. Writing sample test.

When I am tired I am getting back to my unsolved problem with relative steps feature.

### Today I Learned:
* Princliples of testing.
* Magic of parseInt()
* Using my new toy - tablet :) Now I am fully equiped for my fron-end development with sesign inclinations. It is kind of distracting!

_To sum up_:
Cannot wait till my relative substeps starts working.
