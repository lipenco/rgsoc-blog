title: The Code of Impression
---

[Impress Builder](http://impress-builder.herokuapp.com/) will impress you, I am sure. Check it now.

It is hard to stop working on it. Fortunately there is still lot of pleasure in it, it will not be finished so soon.

### Today I Learned:
* More controllers.
* Rails shows no mercy when it comes to code correctness. In browser my JS code worked just fine, to run it on Rails I have to fix it.
* I got excited about AngularJS.


_To sum up_:
This time I have a beer in my fridge. I will open vodka when the button 'download zip' gets to work.
