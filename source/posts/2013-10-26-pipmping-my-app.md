jQuery UI is exactly the magic I need - resizing, sorting, dragging makes me happier about the usability of ImpressLab.

Every change brings a plague of many bugs. Working on landing page in progress.


### Today I Learned:
* I hate interviews, and everybody who thinks I want to work for them for free.
* Backbone.js

_To sum up_:
Sad because these are the last days of RGSoC. I will not finish working on ImpressLab - too much fun.
