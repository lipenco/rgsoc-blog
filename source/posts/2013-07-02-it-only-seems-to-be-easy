title: It Only Looks that Simple

But is is not.
[This is what I did today](http://lipen.co/theme-impress/theme-index.html#/slide1) - it's a work in progress for a universal and aesthetic template for the masses. 


### Today I Learned:
* I can spend 3h choosing and adjusting images - it is kind of annoying to have too many ideas and nice pictures to choose from. 
* Photoshop is a terrible trap that caught me and didn't want to let me go.
* The first day of [EuroPython](https://ep2013.europython.eu) was rough for me - just too much Python. But at least it let me go forwrd with my impress.js 'assignments'.
* Right positioning in impress.js is kind of difficult. 


_To sum up_:
Limoncello does taste like a lemon soap, but it makes you feel so Florentine.
