title: Ninja Style
---

JavaScript is becoming more domesticated. I made 6 template generators, and it really seems I can contribute to impress.js and make user's life easier. 

I had Skype call with my mentor Chris, who shared with me his golden tip: "code like a Ninja". True Ninja would add one or two lines to the root code and work would be done, but Chris quickly produce and explain also more lame solution (in separate script) without even a drop of sweat sitting in hot New Jersey. I really think it was not too easy to generate slides template in the "snake" grid style like this:

					1st slide, 2nd slide, 3rd slide, 4th slide,
					8th slide, 7th slide, 6th slide, 5th slide,
					9th slide, 10th slide, 11th slide, 12th slide...

My [Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/Bi7XqDyM/impress-js-summer-of-code) looks like a military proving ground, [GitHub impress repo](https://github.com/lipenco/theme-impress/commit/77a454becafb577d176983b6af1eb59ca19a7fdb#commitcomment-3636545) like my essays form school - so many comments and corrections. If my literature teacher had had so much patience for me like Bartek I would definitely have become a literature teacher. Luck me, he had not. 


### Today I Learned:
* How combine functions in functions and reverse slides direction.
* How makes JavaScript understand what I want.
* Small parenthesis can make you feel stupid, if you don't add them in a right place.
* Nice tools like [jsbeautifier](http://jsbeautifier.org/) and [JS Hint](http://jshint.com/)
* Watermelon has 300 kcl for 1kg. 

_To sum up_:
If I think twice, I will figure it out on the fifth attempt.
