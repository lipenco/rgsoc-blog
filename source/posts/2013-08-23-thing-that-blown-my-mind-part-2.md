title: Things that Have Blown my Mind Part 2
---

Wow, have you heard about Canvas? It absolutely has blown my mind, and change the way I design the websites. There is very nice, approachable video course on this subject on [pluralssight.com](http://pluralsight.com/training/Courses/TableOfContents/html5-canvas-fundamentals). The service is paid, but you can manage to watch it in your free 10 days trial.

And what are the effects? Mine are pretty nice - I designed [portfolio website](http://lipen.co/kinga-michalska/) for my friend who is a photographer.

I am also working on my app in Rails. It already listens to the user input and renders as many slides as she/he wants. Unfortunately impress.js doesn't work. I will figure out why.


### Today I Learned:
* How to optimize loading time for heavy websites with a lot of pictures.
* Canvas and its API
* Why I need controllers in Rails
* How to render certain number of slides in my application

_To sum up_:
John's method of learning based on asking questions is kind of irritating, but let's see if it's effective.
