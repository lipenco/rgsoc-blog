title: Let's Fix my Mess Up
---

Today is the fixing day. Bartek reviewed my recent code and it turned out I have a lot code to polish up. Attention to details is not my primary virtue.

Anyways, it seems like I built all functionalities user may want to build his/her presentation so it is time to design the way my code will be used.

We are thinking about web application with html code generator, where user can choose features he/she wants and download pre-made presentation. Awesome, isn't it :) Working beyond qualification is probably the most exciting thing in all IT professions.


### Today I Learned:
* What I already knew - I need to focus more on details.
* (Yesterday) some Rails for sport and fun.
* (Yesterday) Ajax for sport, fun and glory.
* All this substring() shit which made me nervous.


_To sum up_:
It is kind of frustrating when John doesn't want/cannot help me right away when I am asking him to, but it is so much nicer to say: "I don't need you, problem's solved".
