title: New Tools in my Front End Pocket
---

Yesterday I finished my [assignments with test](https://github.com/lipenco/impress.js-tests) - writing them in two frameworks: Jasmine and Qtest and I have a feeling I made a step forward. I was sceptical at the beginning, but now I see some potential in this tool.

Today I will focus on Ajax. It has nothing to do with impress.js, since it does not communicate with the server but the goal of my 3-month RgSoC is to make a 'true' programmer form me. This is why without Ajax my Javascript path is incomplete.

### Today I Learned:
* How to run and pass Jasmine and Qtest tests.
* Studying Ajax in progress.
* I am learning Russian letters from my mistakes - instead of milk, I bought a kefir. Kind of like my JavaScript learning process. ;p


_To sum up_:
Waiting for Bartek to get back from vacations.
