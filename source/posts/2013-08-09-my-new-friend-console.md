title: My New Friend - Console
---

One month of intensive Java Code writing and only now I discovered how helpful console in the browser can be.

Problematic relative positioning became quite simple, all errors understandable and solvable.Now my code puts the next slide with relative data attributes like data-x="+1000" 1000 px ahead of the previous step. [What a nice feature](https://github.com/lipenco/impress.js-relative-positioning/blob/gh-pages/js/relativepositioning.js).

### Today I Learned:
* How to use console and deduct the solution.


_To sum up_:
It is easier to start new project than to finish the old one. Today I made myself to work on one of my [portfolio projects](http://lipen.co/projektpolska.is/).
