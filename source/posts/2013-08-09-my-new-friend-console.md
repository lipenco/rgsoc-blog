title: My New Friend - Console
---

One month of intesive Java Code writting and only now I discovered how helpful console in the browser can be.

Problematic relative positioning became quite simple, all errors understable and solvable.Now my code puts the next slide with relative data attributes like data-x="+1000" 1000px ahead of the previous step. What a nice feature.

### Today I Learned:
* How to use console and deduct the solution.


_To sum up_:
It is easier to start new project than to finish the old one.
