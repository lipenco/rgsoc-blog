title: Don't count your chickens before they are on Heroku

It was a very productive day with my [application - Impress Builder](http://impress-builder.herokuapp.com/), but the moment I deployed the app to Heroku the charm of coding has gone.

Another 3h of debugging started. Assets precompiler is a hard rival. But the winner can be only one ;].


### Today I Learned:
* Few can be done without John in case of bug emergency.

_To sum up_:
I wish I had a beer in the fridge. My app is awesome.
