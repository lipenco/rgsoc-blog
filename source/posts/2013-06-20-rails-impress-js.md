title: Rails, impress.js, Design & Disappointment.
---

I’ll give you $10 if you can get this application to work on my computer. Additional features like air conditioning highly desirable. You in?

After a productive couple of hours working on implementating my classy design for Speakerinnen Liste with [Bettina](https://github.com/thatbettina) and [Maren](https://github.com/zaziemo) (members of the [Ruby Monsters](https://github.com/rubymonsters) team form Berlin) we apparently had some achievements. Though, if it hadn’t been for John’s help we would have made just a big mess in the code. It’s too bad that when I tried to run the application on my own computer it didn’t work. I'm having problems with the database. 

I had to stop working on design implementation until the problem is resolved. Instead, I put my hands into [impress.js](https://github.com/bartaz/impress.js/) – the open source project I will work on this summer. I'm working with Bartek, impress.js’ owner, and my coaches - John, Chris, and Tom. To understand what is going on behind the scenes, I read the documentation and went through the jQuery code. My jQuery skills can be compared to my Spanish skills – I understand to a certain extent, but active use is quite miserable. I think I have to focus more on this framework.

Impress.js has a challenge on [ChallengePost](http://impressjs.challengepost.com/). It is a great opportunity to practice a little before I start the Summer of Code. I am building a presentation about tax evasion while trying to add new features to the framework. I already made some very fancy CSS3 effects, but I guess the art of this challenge is to translate this mess of CSS into jQuery and make using the features universal and simple. I will try hard, but am not too optimistic about my ability to do it at this point. With JavaScript or without – I promise to gift your eyes. 

### Today I Learned:
* A good chank of CSS animations and 3D transformation effects.
* How to create sub-steps in my presenatation by showing hidden content with a CSS delay property.
* I started to believe I have to erase my computer to get this database to work.

_To sum up_:
Steve Jobs would have checked out much sooner had he known this was the way I could set up my developer’s tools.
