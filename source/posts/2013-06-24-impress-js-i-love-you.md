title: Impress.js I Love You, but You Turn me Down
---

John saved me (again) and reset all the mess from my computer (pff. machine ;p). He dictated (as dictators do) to use [Boxen](http://boxen.github.com) and Time Machine. Now I can run the Speakerinnen application from localhost. John as my backseat developer is just irreplaceable. Well, he is irreplaceable anyways.

I started my day with [impress.js](https://github.com/bartaz/impress.js/), having a briliant idea to steal some features I need for my presentation form [Jmpress.js](http://jmpressjs.github.io/jmpress.js/#/home) (the framework based on impress.js). As unfair as it sounds, using libraries doesn't make you a developer. After trying and trying I was beaten up and decided to get to JavaScript fundaments. I started reading the book ["Java Script - Enlightement"](http://www.javascriptenlightenment.com/), which was a perfect intro to an afternoon nap. Nonetheless I belive it is the right way to get some front-end power and jump form imitation into creation.

Today, on my last Rubymonster Monday meet up in Berlin we [merged my design to master](https://github.com/rubymonsters/speakerinnen_liste/commit/986468c18e527b06b9c047102c4a0ca5a543f59a). It was a nice and rewarding feeling. I will miss this crew, especially now that this project has gained momentum. I am not a person who gets mushy on the sound of the word "community," and even less when it comes to all this feminism bullsh..hmm... discourse, but RailsGirls really makes a lot of sense. 

### Today I Learned:
* With a liitle bit of cheating, stealing and PS transforming you can figure out how to make a decent logo for free.
* Reading books about programing is like reading porno stories, so much work to imagine it all, it is so much better to just to it.
* Peer to peer learning is effective maybe 15% of the time, but it is worth every minute you wasted on it.
* Git is exactly what it means.

_To sum up_:
I am so enthiusiastic about my nerdy life that I added a new moving gradient footer to the blog, even if it has a similar aesthetic to Kreusberg and Nukloin's clothing shops mixed with a bit of kebab smell.
