So here I am - 1500 100 900 tabs open with tutorials and articles about JavaScript and CSS3. I am trying to be attentive - these are my mentor's recommendations.

Today, on our first weekly meeting, we set our a tactical plan for this week. The gole is to provide impress.js users with some premade themes. The most challenging part will be to pretend that I understand every single line of the impress.js code.

We also discussed if we should care about your grandfather using IE(10) or not and how can we please him as well. Look at my [Trello Board](https://trello.com/board/impress-js-summer-of-code/51bee39938cdf46401002f4e) to see how it is going.


### Today I Learned:
* The book ['Building Impressive Presentations with Impress.js'](http://www.amazon.com/dp/1849696489) was surprisingly interesting and informative.
* I finally understood how to use Git. I won't mess up the  Rubymonsters repository any more.
* The [EuroPython](https://ep2013.europython.eu/p3/live/) schedule doesn't seduce me, but I will give it a try tomorrow.

_To sum up_:
Passive knowledge isn't worth my time.
