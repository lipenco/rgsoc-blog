title: Rails App for impress.js
---

Let's start a new chapter of my RGSoC. My product features ready are waiting for a good use. My imaginary user would like to have an easy life, minimize the time spent on coding and if possible has all the presentation ready in 2 min.

My goal is to build the code generator, which will enable user to get pre-made html, js and css files tailored for her/his needs. 


### Today I Learned:
* I just woke up, but will learn a lot.

_To sum up_:
Dreaming about code is kind of quirky.
