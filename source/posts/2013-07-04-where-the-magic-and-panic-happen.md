title: Where the Magic and Panic Happen
---

Today I touched the guts. It was my JavaScript day. I finished up the "Javascript Enlighment" book, but with the feeling that I still don't know anything I sat with John to reviews some impress.js JavaScript code.

After 2 hours we found ourselves on 75th line (out of 800). Guys, this is so difficult!
Stuff like 'use strict', IIFE... OMG! Guys, it is wild.

John is invinceble: 'ok, let's skip that, I will ask Bartek', I said being beaten by the code. 
'No, I also want to to understand', his striving for knowledge made us slower, me more nervous and him more proud of his teaching skills.

### Today I Learned:
* Dealing with impress.js JS code is super difficult.
* Dealing with JS books are super boring and it won't teach you JS.
* You should try understand with impress.js because it is wild.
* You should take a nap every 100 lines of impress.js JS code.
* Rotation of crops helps you to stay excited and not to panic: on a side I am doing my [friend's website](http://lipen.co/til-informal-tech-education/)


_To sum up_:
'Certain things are false, everything else is true' - 'JavaScript Enlightement', p. 91%.
