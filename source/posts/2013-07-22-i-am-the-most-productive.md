title: I am the Most Productive out of all People I Talked Today on FB.
---

Waiting for new problems and tasks is more tiring than solving them. Every monday they come with the evening Skype call with Bartek. 

During the day I stuffed my time with all kinds of tutorials, conferences talks and articles. Starting day with CS50, than my favorite, because video tutorial for [JS and JQuery](http://learn.appendto.com/lesson/dom-manipulation-101#118), [CSS conference in Amsterdam](http://vimeo.com/channels/cssday) streaming straight to my computer in Rome. A lot of new ideas, inspiration and distraction. And finally comes what I was waiting for - new challenges, code refactoring, solving small/big problems of impress.js users. Excitement.

My [Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/Bi7XqDyM/impress-js-summer-of-code) again looks exactly how I like it.

### Today I Learned:
* Functions in jQuery with callbacks.
* Difficult words like cubic-bezier.
* How end() can do for me.
* How I should refactor the code (almost).
* Recursion. Debugging. File I/O. Structures. Pointers. Dynamic memory allocation. Heap.

_To sum up_:
I know too little to be incompetent.
