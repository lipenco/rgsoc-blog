    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;But is is not. &lt;a href='http://lipen.co/theme-impress/theme-index.html#/slide1'&gt;This is what I did today&lt;/a&gt; - work in progress of building some universal, aesthetic template for masses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id='today_i_learned'&gt;Today I Learned:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I can spend 3h choosing and adjusting right images - it is kind of annoying to have too many ideas and nice pictures stored for one template.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Photoshop is a terrible trap that coatch me and didn&amp;#8217;t want to let me out.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;EuroPython is good for everybody but people who want to learn something about front-end and open source. Even is the lecture title doesn&amp;#8217;t seem so.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Right positioning in impress.js is kind of difficult.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;To sum up&lt;/em&gt;: Limoncello does taste like a lemon soap, but it makes you feel so Florentine.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So here I am - 1500 100 900 tabs open with tutorials and articles about JavaScript and CSS3. I am trying to be attentive - these are my mentor&amp;#8217;s recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, on our first weekly meeting, we set our a tactical plan for this week. The gole is to provide impress.js users with some premade themes. The most challenging part will be to pretend that I understand every single line of the impress.js code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also discussed if we should care about your grandfather using IE(10) or not and how can we please him as well. Look at my &lt;a href='https://trello.com/board/impress-js-summer-of-code/51bee39938cdf46401002f4e'&gt;Trello Board&lt;/a&gt; to see how it is going.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id='today_i_learned'&gt;Today I Learned:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The book &lt;a href='http://www.amazon.com/dp/1849696489'&gt;&amp;#8216;Building Impressive Presentations with Impress.js&amp;#8217;&lt;/a&gt; was surprisingly interesting and informative.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;I finally understood how to use Git. I won&amp;#8217;t mess up the Rubymonsters repository any more.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href='https://ep2013.europython.eu/p3/live/'&gt;EuroPython&lt;/a&gt; schedule doesn&amp;#8217;t seduce me, but I will give it a try tomorrow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;To sum up&lt;/em&gt;: Passive knowledge isn&amp;#8217;t worth my time.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Building a presentation with impress.js is like Disneyland - it will never be finished. There is always something you can add or correct. But I am done with &lt;a href='http://impressjs.challengepost.com/'&gt;ChallengePost&lt;/a&gt;. I don&amp;#8217;t want to hear about Google tax evasion any more. This gradient has burned out my eyes. Try to look as it for 9h a day for a week, you will/won&amp;#8217;t see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here it is, my &lt;a href='http://lipen.co/google-tax-evasion-presentation/'&gt;awesome presentation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We planned, we discussed, and now I know what I don&amp;#8217;t know, much better. We set our goal for the summer project clear and simple: make impress.js easy to use for less tech savvy &lt;code&gt;||&lt;/code&gt; lazy people. I&amp;#8217;ll need to boost my CSS3 and JavaScript skills in order to achieve this goal. But the most important thing I learned from my first call with my mentor is that he is exactly the person I need and want to work with. Dedicated and willing to share his knowledge. &amp;#8220;I don&amp;#8217;t want to limit my role as a mentor to reviewing the code and setting tasks for you, I am happy to teach you stuff,&amp;#8221; he said. Just perfect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are going to use a &lt;a href='https://trello.com/board/impress-js-summer-of-code/51bee39938cdf46401002f4e'&gt;Trello board&lt;/a&gt; to manage the chaos. Feel more than welcome to spy on this stuff. Knowing you&amp;#8217;re watching will make me more ambitious even though I probably wouldn&amp;#8217;t survive working any more each day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I planned to continue on reading my favourite bed story about the omnipotent JavaScript and &lt;a href='http://www.amazon.com/dp/1849696489'&gt;book about impress.js&lt;/a&gt;, but I just spent all my time on preparing my presentation testing out animations and sub-step features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id='today_i_learned'&gt;Today I Learned:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I discovered a wonderful framework: &lt;a href='http://daneden.me/animate/'&gt;animate.css&lt;/a&gt; and a hidden gem, &lt;a href='https://github.com/tehfoo/impress.js'&gt;impress.js - sub-steps&lt;/a&gt;, that provides navigation sub-steps for presentations. I am curious what keeps Bartek from merging this code.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;jQuery documentation is the least helpful crap I have seen.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Being the owner of popular open source project is like a full time job â€“ judging by the number of discussion and GitHub issues Bartek to responds to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;To sum up&lt;/em&gt;: Searching for ready to use coding solutions sux but at least I found &lt;a href='http://pudelekx.pl/na-bahamach-jest-plaza-dla-swin-7466'&gt;this!&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;John saved me (again) and reset all the mess from my computer (pff. machine ;p). He dictated (as dictators do) to use &lt;a href='http://boxen.github.com'&gt;Boxen&lt;/a&gt; and Time Machine. Now I can run the Speakerinnen application from localhost. John as my backseat developer is just irreplaceable. Well, he is irreplaceable anyways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started my day with &lt;a href='https://github.com/bartaz/impress.js/'&gt;impress.js&lt;/a&gt;, having a briliant idea to steal some features I need for my presentation form &lt;a href='http://jmpressjs.github.io/jmpress.js/#/home'&gt;Jmpress.js&lt;/a&gt; (the framework based on impress.js). As unfair as it sounds, using libraries doesn&amp;#8217;t make you a developer. After trying and trying I was beaten up and decided to get to JavaScript fundaments. I started reading the book &lt;a href='http://www.javascriptenlightenment.com/'&gt;&amp;#8220;Java Script - Enlightement&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt;, which was a perfect intro to an afternoon nap. Nonetheless I belive it is the right way to get some front-end power and jump form imitation into creation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, on my last Rubymonster Monday meet up in Berlin we &lt;a href='https://github.com/rubymonsters/speakerinnen_liste/commit/986468c18e527b06b9c047102c4a0ca5a543f59a'&gt;merged my design to master&lt;/a&gt;. It was a nice and rewarding feeling. I will miss this crew, especially now that this project has gained momentum. I am not a person who gets mushy on the sound of the word &amp;#8220;community,&amp;#8221; and even less when it comes to all this feminism bullsh..hmm&amp;#8230; discourse, but RailsGirls really makes a lot of sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id='today_i_learned'&gt;Today I Learned:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With a liitle bit of cheating, stealing and PS transforming you can figure out how to make a decent logo for free.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Reading books about programing is like reading porno stories, so much work to imagine it all, it is so much better to just to it.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Peer to peer learning is effective maybe 15% of the time, but it is worth every minute you wasted on it.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Git is exactly what it means.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;To sum up&lt;/em&gt;: I am so enthiusiastic about my nerdy life that I added a new moving gradient footer to the blog, even if it has a similar aesthetic to Kreusberg and Nukloin&amp;#8217;s clothing shops mixed with a bit of kebab smell.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Iâ€™ll give you $10 if you can get this application to work on my computer. Additional features like air conditioning highly desirable. You in?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a productive couple of hours working on implementating my classy design for Speakerinnen Liste with &lt;a href='https://github.com/thatbettina'&gt;Bettina&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href='https://github.com/zaziemo'&gt;Maren&lt;/a&gt; (members of the &lt;a href='https://github.com/rubymonsters'&gt;Ruby Monsters&lt;/a&gt; team form Berlin) we apparently had some achievements. Though, if it hadnâ€™t been for Johnâ€™s help we would have made just a big mess in the code. Itâ€™s too bad that when I tried to run the application on my own computer it didnâ€™t work. I&amp;#8217;m having problems with the database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had to stop working on design implementation until the problem is resolved. Instead, I put my hands into &lt;a href='https://github.com/bartaz/impress.js/'&gt;impress.js&lt;/a&gt; â€“ the open source project I will work on this summer. I&amp;#8217;m working with Bartek, impress.jsâ€™ owner, and my coaches - John, Chris, and Tom. To understand what is going on behind the scenes, I read the documentation and went through the jQuery code. My jQuery skills can be compared to my Spanish skills â€“ I understand to a certain extent, but active use is quite miserable. I think I have to focus more on this framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Impress.js has a challenge on &lt;a href='http://impressjs.challengepost.com/'&gt;ChallengePost&lt;/a&gt;. It is a great opportunity to practice a little before I start the Summer of Code. I am building a presentation about tax evasion while trying to add new features to the framework. I already made some very fancy CSS3 effects, but I guess the art of this challenge is to translate this mess of CSS into jQuery and make using the features universal and simple. I will try hard, but am not too optimistic about my ability to do it at this point. With JavaScript or without â€“ I promise to gift your eyes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id='today_i_learned'&gt;Today I Learned:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A good chank of CSS animations and 3D transformation effects.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;How to create sub-steps in my presenatation by showing hidden content with a CSS delay property.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;I started to believe I have to erase my computer to get this database to work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;To sum up&lt;/em&gt;: Steve Jobs would have checked out much sooner had he known this was the way I could set up my developerâ€™s tools.&lt;/p&gt;</content>
