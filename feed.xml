&lt;h2 id='title_dziaa_pol_it_works_hurra_hurra'&gt;title: Dzia≈Ça! (pol. it works) Hurra, Hurra!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The end of the theoretical muttering about objects and arrays came with new assignments. Though it has been difficult, step by step, I am preparing a slide position generator. This tasks seems to be as exciting as it is frustrating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first exercise sounds easy: &amp;#8220;Let&amp;#8217;s assume that the HTML for an impress.js presentation is created (all steps) but without &lt;code&gt;data-attribute&lt;/code&gt;s. So steps don&amp;#8217;t have any position defined in HTML. (..) Write a script that runs before impress.init() that adds some positions to all steps. (..).&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was jumping for happiness when my simple &lt;a href='https://github.com/lipenco/impress.js-myscript'&gt;for loop&lt;/a&gt; worked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a nice talk with my friend, an experienced developer. He tried hard to persuade me to start with Java or C#. In his opinion, JavaScript is not the right place to start: it is difficult to debug and it is hard to learn all the programming logic in the browser. &amp;#8220;The language is not important, abstract thinking and code writing are skills you need now.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am thinking seriously about getting back to the &lt;a href='https://www.edx.org/course/harvard-university/cs50x/introduction-computer-science/1022'&gt;CS50x&lt;/a&gt; computer science course from Harvard that I started a long time ago and never finished. It was just too painful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id='today_i_learned'&gt;Today I Learned:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thanks to Bartek I understood that impress.js is not listening to any code I am writing outside this function, which wasn&amp;#8217;t too obvious for me.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;He taught me many other things, and found out that sometimes I pretend I understand.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;How to make a CSS hovering animated effect that doesn&amp;#8217;t go back after hovering ends. &lt;a href='http://jsfiddle.net/rHpDn/3/'&gt;Here is a nice example.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;To sum up&lt;/em&gt;: Success should be celebrated.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;No! Why should I write my own JS code if there are so many nice books to read about it. The suspense just keep me hooked into reading more and more of them. It is a drama and the climax seems to be unreachable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='http://eloquentjavascript.net/'&gt;Eloquent JavaScript&lt;/a&gt; is the best position about JS I&amp;#8217;ve read so far. Not only because I can read it in Polish. I am working my ass off doing (most of) book&amp;#8217;s exercises, but let&amp;#8217;s face it - it is just not right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides I finished my two templates. I am excited about the feedback -I will get it tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The disappointing experience was my attempt to figure out how to solve the problem of &lt;a href='https://github.com/bartaz/impress.js/pull/131'&gt;relative step positioning in impress.js&lt;/a&gt;. I need to give a try again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id='today_i_learned'&gt;Today I Learned:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Closures, recursion, scopes (again), looping (again), strict mode (again)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Polish words in programming sounds so surprising.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Reading JavaScript code out loud, line by line with someone who is able to correct you and explain things is 100 times more helpful than reading books and repeating theory. John said it was fun to explain impress.js to me. I felt sorry for him all these long hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took longer than expected, but I am kind of proud that I am able to translate this code into words. Still I have a feeling that the path from understanding to writing is long and bumpy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id='today_i_learned'&gt;Today I Learned:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My project management is not great (yet), but I don&amp;#8217;t mind reading code in the train on Saturday. I will be ready with all my assignments for my call with Bartek on Monday.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide'&gt;JavaScript Guide by Mozilla&lt;/a&gt; is worth reading.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;I am getting this strange habit, that instead of facebooking to relax I am looking for and staring on GitHub cool open source projects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;To sum up&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfT-ISOwRtw'&gt;Will never be a summer like this&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today I touched the guts. It was my JavaScript day. I finished up the &amp;#8220;Javascript Enlighment&amp;#8221; book, but with the feeling that I still don&amp;#8217;t know anything, I sat with John to reviews some impress.js JavaScript code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After 2 hours we found ourselves on the 75th line (out of 800). Guys, this is so difficult! Stuff like &amp;#8216;use strict&amp;#8217;, &lt;a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immediately-invoked_function_expression'&gt;IIFE&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8230; OMG! Guys, it is wild.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John is invincible: &amp;#8220;Ok, let&amp;#8217;s skip that, I will ask Bartek,&amp;#8221; I said being beaten by the code. &amp;#8220;No, I also want to to understand&amp;#8221;, his striving for knowledge made us slower, me more nervous and him more proud of his teaching skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id='today_i_learned'&gt;Today I Learned:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dealing with impress.js JS code is super difficult.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Dealing with JS books are super boring and they won&amp;#8217;t teach you JS.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;You should try understand impress.js code because it is wild.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;You should take a nap every 100 lines of impress.js JS code.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Rotation of crops helps you to stay excited and not to panic: on the side I am doing my &lt;a href='http://lipen.co/til-informal-tech-education/'&gt;friend&amp;#8217;s website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;To sum up&lt;/em&gt;: &amp;#8216;Certain things are false, everything else is true&amp;#8217; - &amp;#8216;JavaScript Enlightement&amp;#8217;, p. 91%.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;h3 id='today_i_learned'&gt;Today I Learned:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I can spend 3h choosing and adjusting images - it is kind of annoying to have too many ideas and nice pictures to choose from.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Photoshop is a terrible trap that caught me and didn&amp;#8217;t want to let me go.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The first day of &lt;a href='https://ep2013.europython.eu'&gt;EuroPython&lt;/a&gt; was rough for me - just too much Python. But at least it let me go forwrd with my impress.js &amp;#8216;assignments&amp;#8217;.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Right positioning in impress.js is kind of difficult.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;To sum up&lt;/em&gt;: Limoncello does taste like a lemon soap, but it makes you feel so Florentine.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So here I am - 1500 100 900 tabs open with tutorials and articles about JavaScript and CSS3. I am trying to be attentive - these are my mentor&amp;#8217;s recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, on our first weekly meeting, we set our a tactical plan for this week. The gole is to provide impress.js users with some premade themes. The most challenging part will be to pretend that I understand every single line of the impress.js code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also discussed if we should care about your grandfather using IE(10) or not and how can we please him as well. Look at my &lt;a href='https://trello.com/board/impress-js-summer-of-code/51bee39938cdf46401002f4e'&gt;Trello Board&lt;/a&gt; to see how it is going.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id='today_i_learned'&gt;Today I Learned:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The book &lt;a href='http://www.amazon.com/dp/1849696489'&gt;&amp;#8216;Building Impressive Presentations with Impress.js&amp;#8217;&lt;/a&gt; was surprisingly interesting and informative.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;I finally understood how to use Git. I won&amp;#8217;t mess up the Rubymonsters repository any more.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href='https://ep2013.europython.eu/p3/live/'&gt;EuroPython&lt;/a&gt; schedule doesn&amp;#8217;t seduce me, but I will give it a try tomorrow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;To sum up&lt;/em&gt;: Passive knowledge isn&amp;#8217;t worth my time.&lt;/p&gt;</content>
