<p>John saved me (again) and reset all the mess from my computer (pff. machine ;p). He dictated (as dictators do) to use <a href='http://boxen.github.com'>Boxen</a> and Time Machine. Now I can run the Speakerinnen application get from localhost. John as my backseat developer is just irreplaceable. Well, he is irreplaceable anyways.</p>

<p>I started my day with <a href='https://github.com/bartaz/impress.js/'>impress.js</a>, having a briliant idea to steal some features I need for my presentation form <a href='http://jmpressjs.github.io/jmpress.js/#/home'>Jmpress.js</a> (the framework based on impress.js). As unfair as it sounds, using libraries doesn&#8217;t make you a developer. After trying and trying I was beaten up and decided to get to JavaScript fundaments. I started reading the book <a href='http://www.javascriptenlightenment.com/'>&#8220;Java Script - Enlightement&#8221;</a>, which was a perfect intro to an afternoon nap. Nonetheless I belive it is the right way to get some front-end power and jump form imitation into creation.</p>

<p>Today, on my last Rubymonster Monday meet up in Berlin we <a href='https://github.com/rubymonsters/speakerinnen_liste/commit/986468c18e527b06b9c047102c4a0ca5a543f59a'>merged my design to master</a>. It was a nice and rewarding feeling. I will miss this crew, especially now that this project has gained momentum. I am not a person who gets mushy on the sound of the word &#8220;community,&#8221; and even less when it comes to all this feminism bullsh..hmm&#8230; discourse, but RailsGirls really makes a lot of sense.</p>

<h3 id='today_i_learned'>Today I Learned:</h3>

<ul>
<li>With a liitle bit of cheating, stealing and PS transforming you can figure out how to make a decent logo for free.</li>

<li>Reading books about programing is like reading porno stories, so much work to imagine it all, it is so much better to just to it.</li>

<li>Peer to peer learning is effective maybe 15% of the time, but it is worth every minute you wasted on it.</li>

<li>Git is exactly what it means.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>To sum up</em>: I am so enthiusiastic about my nerdy life that I added a new moving gradient footer to the blog, even if it has a similar aesthetic to Kreusberg and Nukloin&#8217;s clothing shops mixed with a bit of kebab smell.</p>

<p>I’ll give you $10 if you can get this application to work on my computer. Additional features like air conditioning highly desirable. You in?</p>

<p>After a productive couple of hours working on implementating my classy design for Speakerinnen Liste with <a href='https://github.com/thatbettina'>Bettina</a> and <a href='https://github.com/zaziemo'>Maren</a> (members of the <a href='https://github.com/rubymonsters'>Ruby Monsters</a> team form Berlin) we apparently had some achievements. Though, if it hadn’t been for John’s help we would have made just a big mess in the code. It’s too bad that when I tried to run the application on my own computer it didn’t work. I&#8217;m having problems with the database.</p>

<p>I had to stop working on design implementation until the problem is resolved. Instead, I put my hands into <a href='https://github.com/bartaz/impress.js/'>impress.js</a> – the open source project I will work on this summer. I&#8217;m working with Bartek, impress.js’ owner, and my coaches - John, Chris, and Tom. To understand what is going on behind the scenes, I read the documentation and went through the jQuery code. My jQuery skills can be compared to my Spanish skills – I understand to a certain extent, but active use is quite miserable. I think I have to focus more on this framework.</p>

<p>Impress.js has a challenge on <a href='http://impressjs.challengepost.com/'>ChallengePost</a>. It is a great opportunity to practice a little before I start the Summer of Code. I am building a presentation about tax evasion while trying to add new features to the framework. I already made some very fancy CSS3 effects, but I guess the art of this challenge is to translate this mess of CSS into jQuery and make using the features universal and simple. I will try hard, but am not too optimistic about my ability to do it at this point. With JavaScript or without – I promise to gift your eyes.</p>

<h3 id='today_i_learned'>Today I Learned:</h3>

<ul>
<li>A good chank of CSS animations and 3D transformation effects.</li>

<li>How to create sub-steps in my presenatation by showing hidden content with a CSS delay property.</li>

<li>I started to believe I have to erase my computer to get this database to work.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>To sum up</em>: Steve Jobs would have checked out much sooner had he known this was the way I could set up my developer’s tools.</p>

<p>Time to prepare for the Rails Girls Summer of Code. My first task was to create this blog to track my work. It seems like changing my every-day passion into a full-time routine, but as an ex-journalist I&#8217;m looking forward to some exhibitionist pleasure. It&#8217;s most likely a one-sided pleasure, my dear small audience.</p>

<p>Rails Girls Summer of Code starts in two weeks. All the participants are supposed to keep a blog to track progress. I&#8217;ve seen some of them already – beautiful design made in five minutes using popular services. Some people call it effectiveness, but there is such a masochistic pleasure in reinventing the wheel that I can&#8217;t resist. I decided to build my hand-made blog. John believes that the only sensible choice for a developer blog is to use a static website generator. I am under constant static-website propaganda that I started to believe that a good front-end developer does not need to get her hands dirty with PHP and I gave up tha idea of creating a Wordpress theme.</p>

<p><a href='http://middlemanapp.com'>Middleman</a>, the open static website generator made it possible to build all all the blogging infrastructure on my website. I hit a roadblock when I decided to add a <a href='https://github.com/masukomi/kudos'>Kudos</a> feature to my posts. Kudos are definitely too &#8220;osom&#8221; (pol. awesome) to go without. This feature totally made my day, and by made my day I mean it just took all the time. Not only mine, but also John&#8217;s.</p>

<p>jQuery was not enough for building Kudos. We needed a backend to store our Kudos and remember the huge numbers of Kudos you all are going to give me. Since there&#8217;s no way to dyanmically store data on a static website, we had to use something else. <a href='http://parse.com'>Parse</a> to the rescue. After painfully wading through the documentation and trying hundreds of variations of code, we made it. Ok, no-cheating -he made it, I gave up on the back end.</p>

<h3 id='today_i_learned'>Today I Learned:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Looking at someone coding can be more tiring than coding on your own.</li>

<li>Before I show any code to John I have to count and correct my messy code, we will not move forward until it&#8217;s cleaned up.</li>

<li>Learning by watching doesn&#8217;t work, but it sure does speed up your progress.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>To sum up</em>: You&#8217;d better make good use of Kudos - it cost me so much time! Viciously I (we) made it so that you cannot remove your kudo in case you change your mind ;p.</p>
