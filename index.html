<p>So here I am - 1500 100 900 tabs open with tutorials and articles about JavaScript and CSS3. I am trying to be attentive - these are my mentor&#8217;s recommendations.</p>

<p>Today, on our first weekly meeting, we set our a tactical plan for this week. The gole is to provide impress.js users with some premade themes. The most challenging part will be to pretend that I understand every single line of the impress.js code.</p>

<p>We also discussed if we should care about your grandfather using IE(10) or not and how can we please him as well. Look at my <a href='https://trello.com/board/impress-js-summer-of-code/51bee39938cdf46401002f4e'>Trello Board</a> to see how it is going.</p>

<ul>
<li>The book <a href='http://www.amazon.com/dp/1849696489'>&#8216;Building Impressive Presentations with Impress.js&#8217;</a> was surprisingly interesting and informative.</li>

<li>I finally understood how to use Git. I won&#8217;t mess up the Rubymonsters repository any more.</li>

<li>The <a href='https://ep2013.europython.eu/p3/live/'>EuroPython</a> schedule doesn&#8217;t seduce me, but I will give it a try tomorrow.</li>

<p>Building a presentation with impress.js is like Disneyland - it will never be finished. There is always something you can add or correct. But I am done with <a href='http://impressjs.challengepost.com/'>ChallengePost</a>. I don&#8217;t want to hear about Google tax evasion any more. This gradient has burned out my eyes. Try to look as it for 9h a day for a week, you will/won&#8217;t see.</p>

<p>We planned, we discussed, and now I know what I don&#8217;t know, much better. We set our goal for the summer project clear and simple: make impress.js easy to use for less tech savvy <code>||</code> lazy people. I&#8217;ll need to boost my CSS3 and JavaScript skills in order to achieve this goal. But the most important thing I learned from my first call with my mentor is that he is exactly the person I need and want to work with. Dedicated and willing to share his knowledge. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to limit my role as a mentor to reviewing the code and setting tasks for you, I am happy to teach you stuff,&#8221; he said. Just perfect.</p>

<p>We are going to use a <a href='https://trello.com/board/impress-js-summer-of-code/51bee39938cdf46401002f4e'>Trello board</a> to manage the chaos. Feel more than welcome to spy on this stuff. Knowing you&#8217;re watching will make me more ambitious even though I probably wouldn&#8217;t survive working any more each day.</p>

<p>I planned to continue on reading my favourite bed story about the omnipotent JavaScript and <a href='http://www.amazon.com/dp/1849696489'>book about impress.js</a>, but I just spent all my time on preparing my presentation testing out animations and sub-step features.</p>

<h3 id='today_i_learned'>Today I Learned:</h3>

<ul>
<li>I discovered a wonderful framework: <a href='http://daneden.me/animate/'>animate.css</a> and a hidden gem, <a href='https://github.com/tehfoo/impress.js'>impress.js - sub-steps</a>, that provides navigation sub-steps for presentations. I am curious what keeps Bartek from merging this code.</li>

<li>jQuery documentation is the least helpful crap I have seen.</li>

<li>Being the owner of popular open source project is like a full time job – judging by the number of discussion and GitHub issues Bartek to responds to.</li>

<p>John saved me (again) and reset all the mess from my computer (pff. machine ;p). He dictated (as dictators do) to use <a href='http://boxen.github.com'>Boxen</a> and Time Machine. Now I can run the Speakerinnen application from localhost. John as my backseat developer is just irreplaceable. Well, he is irreplaceable anyways.</p>

<p>I started my day with <a href='https://github.com/bartaz/impress.js/'>impress.js</a>, having a briliant idea to steal some features I need for my presentation form <a href='http://jmpressjs.github.io/jmpress.js/#/home'>Jmpress.js</a> (the framework based on impress.js). As unfair as it sounds, using libraries doesn&#8217;t make you a developer. After trying and trying I was beaten up and decided to get to JavaScript fundaments. I started reading the book <a href='http://www.javascriptenlightenment.com/'>&#8220;Java Script - Enlightement&#8221;</a>, which was a perfect intro to an afternoon nap. Nonetheless I belive it is the right way to get some front-end power and jump form imitation into creation.</p>

<p>Today, on my last Rubymonster Monday meet up in Berlin we <a href='https://github.com/rubymonsters/speakerinnen_liste/commit/986468c18e527b06b9c047102c4a0ca5a543f59a'>merged my design to master</a>. It was a nice and rewarding feeling. I will miss this crew, especially now that this project has gained momentum. I am not a person who gets mushy on the sound of the word &#8220;community,&#8221; and even less when it comes to all this feminism bullsh..hmm&#8230; discourse, but RailsGirls really makes a lot of sense.</p>

<li>With a liitle bit of cheating, stealing and PS transforming you can figure out how to make a decent logo for free.</li>

<li>Reading books about programing is like reading porno stories, so much work to imagine it all, it is so much better to just to it.</li>

<li>Peer to peer learning is effective maybe 15% of the time, but it is worth every minute you wasted on it.</li>

<li>Git is exactly what it means.</li>

<p>I’ll give you $10 if you can get this application to work on my computer. Additional features like air conditioning highly desirable. You in?</p>

<p>After a productive couple of hours working on implementating my classy design for Speakerinnen Liste with <a href='https://github.com/thatbettina'>Bettina</a> and <a href='https://github.com/zaziemo'>Maren</a> (members of the <a href='https://github.com/rubymonsters'>Ruby Monsters</a> team form Berlin) we apparently had some achievements. Though, if it hadn’t been for John’s help we would have made just a big mess in the code. It’s too bad that when I tried to run the application on my own computer it didn’t work. I&#8217;m having problems with the database.</p>

<p>I had to stop working on design implementation until the problem is resolved. Instead, I put my hands into <a href='https://github.com/bartaz/impress.js/'>impress.js</a> – the open source project I will work on this summer. I&#8217;m working with Bartek, impress.js’ owner, and my coaches - John, Chris, and Tom. To understand what is going on behind the scenes, I read the documentation and went through the jQuery code. My jQuery skills can be compared to my Spanish skills – I understand to a certain extent, but active use is quite miserable. I think I have to focus more on this framework.</p>

<p>Impress.js has a challenge on <a href='http://impressjs.challengepost.com/'>ChallengePost</a>. It is a great opportunity to practice a little before I start the Summer of Code. I am building a presentation about tax evasion while trying to add new features to the framework. I already made some very fancy CSS3 effects, but I guess the art of this challenge is to translate this mess of CSS into jQuery and make using the features universal and simple. I will try hard, but am not too optimistic about my ability to do it at this point. With JavaScript or without – I promise to gift your eyes.</p>

<p>Time to prepare for the Rails Girls Summer of Code. My first task was to create this blog to track my work. It seems like changing my every-day passion into a full-time routine, but as an ex-journalist I&#8217;m looking forward to some exhibitionist pleasure. It&#8217;s most likely a one-sided pleasure, my dear small audience.</p>

<p>Rails Girls Summer of Code starts in two weeks. All the participants are supposed to keep a blog to track progress. I&#8217;ve seen some of them already – beautiful design made in five minutes using popular services. Some people call it effectiveness, but there is such a masochistic pleasure in reinventing the wheel that I can&#8217;t resist. I decided to build my hand-made blog. John believes that the only sensible choice for a developer blog is to use a static website generator. I am under constant static-website propaganda that I started to believe that a good front-end developer does not need to get her hands dirty with PHP and I gave up tha idea of creating a Wordpress theme.</p>

<p><a href='http://middlemanapp.com'>Middleman</a>, the open static website generator made it possible to build all all the blogging infrastructure on my website. I hit a roadblock when I decided to add a <a href='https://github.com/masukomi/kudos'>Kudos</a> feature to my posts. Kudos are definitely too &#8220;osom&#8221; (pol. awesome) to go without. This feature totally made my day, and by made my day I mean it just took all the time. Not only mine, but also John&#8217;s.</p>

<p>jQuery was not enough for building Kudos. We needed a backend to store our Kudos and remember the huge numbers of Kudos you all are going to give me. Since there&#8217;s no way to dyanmically store data on a static website, we had to use something else. <a href='http://parse.com'>Parse</a> to the rescue. After painfully wading through the documentation and trying hundreds of variations of code, we made it. Ok, no-cheating -he made it, I gave up on the back end.</p>

<h3 id='today_i_learned'>Today I Learned:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Looking at someone coding can be more tiring than coding on your own.</li>

<li>Before I show any code to John I have to count and correct my messy code, we will not move forward until it&#8217;s cleaned up.</li>

<li>Learning by watching doesn&#8217;t work, but it sure does speed up your progress.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>To sum up</em>: You&#8217;d better make good use of Kudos - it cost me so much time! Viciously I (we) made it so that you cannot remove your kudo in case you change your mind ;p.</p>
