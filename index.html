<p>Have you heard of Single Responsibility Principle? Of course you had not - &#8220;you&#8221; don&#8217;t exist. I keep forgetting nobody is reading this blog;p. Well, Uncle Bob had a <a href='http://vimeo.com/43592685'>great talk</a> about SRP.</p>

<p>But I prefer to listen to my friend Mateusz, who become my unofficial coach. Thanks to him refactoring is my new favourite topic.</p>

<p>Once one function like this:</p>

<pre><code>function layoutLinear(options) {    
    var distance = options.distance;    
    var elements = document.querySelectorAll(&quot;.step&quot;);    
    var position = 100;    
    var scale = 1;    
    if (!distance || distance &lt; 900) {    
        distance = 1500;    
}    
for (var index = 0; index &lt; elements.length; index++) {
    elements[index].dataset.x = position;
    position = position + distance;
    elements[index].dataset.scale = scale;
    if (index % 2 === 0) {
        scale = 2;
    } else {
        scale = 1;
    }</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

<p>Now turned into 3 functions, way more sexy:</p>

<pre><code>function MoveElementsFromEachOther(distance, elements) {   
    var position = parseInt(elements[0].dataset.x);
    for (var index = 0; index &lt; elements.length; index++) {
    position = position + distance;
    elements[index].dataset.x = position; 
    }
}

function RescaleEveryTwoElements(scale, elements) {
    for (var index = 0; index &lt; elements.length; index+=2) {
    elements[index].dataset.scale = 2; 
    }
}

function layoutLinear(distance, scale) {
    var elements = document.querySelectorAll(&quot;.step&quot;);
    elements[0].dataset.x = 0;
    RescaleEveryTwoElements(scale, elements) ;
    MoveElementsFromEachOther(distance, elements) ;
}</code></pre>

<p>Now we have longer, more complicated strucure without any difference in code preformance. Seems like the magic of refactoring is measured is salary of a programmer who know how to do it right ;p But taking into account that my scrip genereates 8 defferents layouts I saved a lot of space, memory and boost the redability.</p>

<p>Waiting for new problems and tasks is more tiring than solving them. Every monday they come with the evening Skype call with Bartek.</p>

<p>During the day I stuffed my time with all kinds of tutorials, conferences talks and articles. Starting day with CS50, than my favorite, because video tutorial for <a href='http://learn.appendto.com/lesson/dom-manipulation-101#118'>JS and JQuery</a>, <a href='http://vimeo.com/channels/cssday'>CSS conference in Amsterdam</a> streaming straight to my computer in Rome. A lot of new ideas, inspiration and distraction. And finally comes what I was waiting for - new challenges, code refactoring, solving small/big problems of impress.js users. Excitement.</p>

<p>My <a href='https://trello.com/b/Bi7XqDyM/impress-js-summer-of-code'>Trello Board</a> again looks exactly how I like it.</p>

<p>Solving problems without resorting to any help are probably the most rewarding moments in learning process. But just the fact it works, does not mean it is good enough. What if the user puts the argument which does not make any sense? Seems like my first idea for - <code>console.log(&quot;you are a bad programmer&quot;)</code> is not exactly acceptable.</p>

<p>But I&#8217;ve found better one:</p>

<p><code>distance &amp;&amp; distance &gt; 700? distance : distance = 1000;</code></p>

<p>But Bartek wanted something more readable, more simple;</p>

<p><code>if (distance &amp;&amp; distance &gt; 700) {
       distance;
    }
    else {
        distance = 1000;
    }</code></p>

<p>Still not sexy enough;</p>

<p><code>if (distance &amp;&amp; distance &gt; 700);
    else {
       distance = 1000;
    }</code></p>

<p>Shorter but not better;</p>

<p><code>if (!(distance &amp;&amp; distance &gt; 700)) {
       distance = 1000;
    }</code></p>

<p>Almost eureka!</p>

<p><code>if (!distance || distance &lt; 700) {
       distance = 1000;
    }</code></p>

<p>So simple!</p>

<p>I decided to go back to the programing principles and practice some logic, sexy syntaxes and abstract thinking with #C. From today, every day I will spend 70 min, with very a guy from Harvard at <a href='https://www.edx.org/course/harvard-university/cs50x/introduction-computer-science/1022'>CS50 Course</a>. It is online, it is free, it has a massive number of cool features, among others, it provides you with build in console for coding in #C.</p>

<p><a href='https://www.edx.org/'>Edx.org</a> is full of courses I want to do as well, but first thing first. With online resorces like this it&#8217;s just clear that traditional school is deprecated.</p>

<p>My impress.js generators looks more and more professional. The user can now invoke the function with creates an automated layout with changeable parameters like distance between slides or radius when it comes to circle layouts.</p>

<p>JavaScript is becoming more domesticated. I made 6 template generators, and it really seems I can contribute to impress.js and make the user&#8217;s life easier.</p>

<p>I had Skype a call with my mentor Chris, who shared with me his golden tip: &#8220;code like a Ninja.&#8221; It means to add as little code as possible to do all the magic. It was not possible this time, as we couldn&#8217;t code inside core impress.js file, but Chris quickly explained and figured out the solution without a drop of sweat. I really think it was not too easy to generate a slide template in the &#8220;snake&#8221; grid style like this:</p>

<pre><code>				1st slide, 2nd slide, 3rd slide, 4th slide,
				8th slide, 7th slide, 6th slide, 5th slide,
				9th slide, 10th slide, 11th slide, 12th slide...</code></pre>

<p>The end of the theoretical muttering about objects and arrays came with new assignments. Though it has been difficult, step by step, I am preparing a slide position generator. This tasks seems to be as exciting as it is frustrating.</p>

<p>The first exercise sounds easy: &#8220;Let&#8217;s assume that the HTML for an impress.js presentation is created (all steps) but without <code>data-attribute</code>s. So steps don&#8217;t have any position defined in HTML. (..) Write a script that runs before impress.init() that adds some positions to all steps. (..).&#8221;</p>

<p>I was jumping for happiness when my simple <a href='https://github.com/lipenco/impress.js-myscript'>for loop</a> worked.</p>

<p>I had a nice talk with my friend, an experienced developer. He tried hard to persuade me to start with Java or C#. In his opinion, JavaScript is not the right place to start: it is difficult to debug and it is hard to learn all the programming logic in the browser. &#8220;The language is not important, abstract thinking and code writing are skills you need now.&#8221;</p>

<p>I am thinking seriously about getting back to the <a href='https://www.edx.org/course/harvard-university/cs50x/introduction-computer-science/1022'>CS50x</a> computer science course from Harvard that I started a long time ago and never finished. It was just too painful.</p>

<h3 id='today_i_learned'>Today I Learned:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Thanks to Bartek I understood that impress.js is not listening to any code I am writing outside this function, which wasn&#8217;t too obvious for me.</li>

<li>He taught me many other things, and found out that sometimes I pretend I understand.</li>

<li>How to make a CSS hovering animated effect that doesn&#8217;t go back after hovering ends. <a href='http://jsfiddle.net/rHpDn/3/'>Here is a nice example.</a></li>

<p>No! Why should I write my own JS code if there are so many nice books to read about it. The suspense just keep me hooked into reading more and more of them. It is a drama and the climax seems to be unreachable.</p>

<p>Reading JavaScript code out loud, line by line with someone who is able to correct you and explain things is 100 times more helpful than reading books and repeating theory. John said it was fun to explain impress.js to me. I felt sorry for him all these long hours.</p>

<p>It took longer than expected, but I am kind of proud that I am able to translate this code into words. Still I have a feeling that the path from understanding to writing is long and bumpy.</p>

<p>Today I touched the guts. It was my JavaScript day. I finished up the &#8220;Javascript Enlighment&#8221; book, but with the feeling that I still don&#8217;t know anything, I sat with John to reviews some impress.js JavaScript code.</p>

<p>After 2 hours we found ourselves on the 75th line (out of 800). Guys, this is so difficult! Stuff like &#8216;use strict&#8217;, <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immediately-invoked_function_expression'>IIFE</a>&#8230; OMG! Guys, it is wild.</p>

<p>John is invincible: &#8220;Ok, let&#8217;s skip that, I will ask Bartek,&#8221; I said being beaten by the code. &#8220;No, I also want to to understand&#8221;, his striving for knowledge made us slower, me more nervous and him more proud of his teaching skills.</p>

<li>Right positioning in impress.js is kind of difficult.</li>
</ul>
