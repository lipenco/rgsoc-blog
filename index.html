<p>JavaScript is becoming more domesticated. I made 6 template generators, and it really seems I can contribute to impress.js and make user&#8217;s life easier.</p>

<p>I had Skype call with my mentor Chris, who shared with me his golden tip: &#8220;code like a Ninja&#8221;. True Ninja would add one or two lines to the root code and work would be done, but Chris quickly produce and explain also more lame solution (in separate script) without even a drop of sweat sitting in hot New Jersey. I really think it was not too easy to generate slides template in the &#8220;snake&#8221; grid style like this:</p>

<pre><code>				1st slide, 2ed slide, 3rd slide, 4th slide,
				8th slide, 7th slide, 6th slide, 5th slide,
				9th slide, 10th slide, 11th slide, 12th slide...</code></pre>

<p>My <a href='https://trello.com/b/Bi7XqDyM/impress-js-summer-of-code'>Trello Board</a> looks like a military proving ground, <a href='https://github.com/lipenco/theme-impress/commit/77a454becafb577d176983b6af1eb59ca19a7fdb#commitcomment-3636545'>GitHub impress repo</a> like my essays form school - so many comments and corrections.

<p>The end of the theoretical muttering about objects and arrays came with new assignments. Though it has been difficult, step by step, I am preparing a slide position generator. This tasks seems to be as exciting as it is frustrating.</p>

<p>The first exercise sounds easy: &#8220;Let&#8217;s assume that the HTML for an impress.js presentation is created (all steps) but without <code>data-attribute</code>s. So steps don&#8217;t have any position defined in HTML. (..) Write a script that runs before impress.init() that adds some positions to all steps. (..).&#8221;</p>

<p>I was jumping for happiness when my simple <a href='https://github.com/lipenco/impress.js-myscript'>for loop</a> worked.</p>

<p>I had a nice talk with my friend, an experienced developer. He tried hard to persuade me to start with Java or C#. In his opinion, JavaScript is not the right place to start: it is difficult to debug and it is hard to learn all the programming logic in the browser. &#8220;The language is not important, abstract thinking and code writing are skills you need now.&#8221;</p>

<p>I am thinking seriously about getting back to the <a href='https://www.edx.org/course/harvard-university/cs50x/introduction-computer-science/1022'>CS50x</a> computer science course from Harvard that I started a long time ago and never finished. It was just too painful.</p>

<h3 id='today_i_learned'>Today I Learned:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Thanks to Bartek I understood that impress.js is not listening to any code I am writing outside this function, which wasn&#8217;t too obvious for me.</li>

<li>He taught me many other things, and found out that sometimes I pretend I understand.</li>

<li>How to make a CSS hovering animated effect that doesn&#8217;t go back after hovering ends. <a href='http://jsfiddle.net/rHpDn/3/'>Here is a nice example.</a></li>

<p>No! Why should I write my own JS code if there are so many nice books to read about it. The suspense just keep me hooked into reading more and more of them. It is a drama and the climax seems to be unreachable.</p>

<p><a href='http://eloquentjavascript.net/'>Eloquent JavaScript</a> is the best position about JS I&#8217;ve read so far. Not only because I can read it in Polish. I am working my ass off doing (most of) book&#8217;s exercises, but let&#8217;s face it - it is just not right.</p>

<p>Besides I finished my two templates. I am excited about the feedback -I will get it tomorrow.</p>

<p>The disappointing experience was my attempt to figure out how to solve the problem of <a href='https://github.com/bartaz/impress.js/pull/131'>relative step positioning in impress.js</a>. I need to give a try again.</p>

<p>Reading JavaScript code out loud, line by line with someone who is able to correct you and explain things is 100 times more helpful than reading books and repeating theory. John said it was fun to explain impress.js to me. I felt sorry for him all these long hours.</p>

<p>It took longer than expected, but I am kind of proud that I am able to translate this code into words. Still I have a feeling that the path from understanding to writing is long and bumpy.</p>

<p>Today I touched the guts. It was my JavaScript day. I finished up the &#8220;Javascript Enlighment&#8221; book, but with the feeling that I still don&#8217;t know anything, I sat with John to reviews some impress.js JavaScript code.</p>

<p>After 2 hours we found ourselves on the 75th line (out of 800). Guys, this is so difficult! Stuff like &#8216;use strict&#8217;, <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immediately-invoked_function_expression'>IIFE</a>&#8230; OMG! Guys, it is wild.</p>

<p>John is invincible: &#8220;Ok, let&#8217;s skip that, I will ask Bartek,&#8221; I said being beaten by the code. &#8220;No, I also want to to understand&#8221;, his striving for knowledge made us slower, me more nervous and him more proud of his teaching skills.</p>

<p>So here I am - 1500 100 900 tabs open with tutorials and articles about JavaScript and CSS3. I am trying to be attentive - these are my mentor&#8217;s recommendations.</p>

<p>Today, on our first weekly meeting, we set our a tactical plan for this week. The gole is to provide impress.js users with some premade themes. The most challenging part will be to pretend that I understand every single line of the impress.js code.</p>

<p>We also discussed if we should care about your grandfather using IE(10) or not and how can we please him as well. Look at my <a href='https://trello.com/board/impress-js-summer-of-code/51bee39938cdf46401002f4e'>Trello Board</a> to see how it is going.</p>

<li>The <a href='https://ep2013.europython.eu/p3/live/'>EuroPython</a> schedule doesn&#8217;t seduce me, but I will give it a try tomorrow.</li>

<p>We planned, we discussed, and now I know what I don&#8217;t know, much better. We set our goal for the summer project clear and simple: make impress.js easy to use for less tech savvy <code>||</code> lazy people. I&#8217;ll need to boost my CSS3 and JavaScript skills in order to achieve this goal. But the most important thing I learned from my first call with my mentor is that he is exactly the person I need and want to work with. Dedicated and willing to share his knowledge. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to limit my role as a mentor to reviewing the code and setting tasks for you, I am happy to teach you stuff,&#8221; he said. Just perfect.</p>

<p>We are going to use a <a href='https://trello.com/board/impress-js-summer-of-code/51bee39938cdf46401002f4e'>Trello board</a> to manage the chaos. Feel more than welcome to spy on this stuff. Knowing you&#8217;re watching will make me more ambitious even though I probably wouldn&#8217;t survive working any more each day.</p>

<p>I planned to continue on reading my favourite bed story about the omnipotent JavaScript and <a href='http://www.amazon.com/dp/1849696489'>book about impress.js</a>, but I just spent all my time on preparing my presentation testing out animations and sub-step features.</p>

I am curious what keeps Bartek from merging this code.</li>

<li>jQuery documentation is the least helpful crap I have seen.</li>

<li>Being the owner of popular open source project is like a full time job ‚Äì judging by the number of discussion and GitHub issues Bartek to responds to.</li>

<p>John saved me (again) and reset all the mess from my computer (pff. machine ;p). He dictated (as dictators do) to use <a href='http://boxen.github.com'>Boxen</a> and Time Machine. Now I can run the Speakerinnen application from localhost. John as my backseat developer is just irreplaceable. Well, he is irreplaceable anyways.</p>

<p>I started my day with <a href='https://github.com/bartaz/impress.js/'>impress.js</a>, having a briliant idea to steal some features I need for my presentation form <a href='http://jmpressjs.github.io/jmpress.js/#/home'>Jmpress.js</a> (the framework based on impress.js). As unfair as it sounds, using libraries doesn&#8217;t make you a developer. After trying and trying I was beaten up and decided to get to JavaScript fundaments. I started reading the book <a href='http://www.javascriptenlightenment.com/'>&#8220;Java Script - Enlightement&#8221;</a>, which was a perfect intro to an afternoon nap. Nonetheless I belive it is the right way to get some front-end power and jump form imitation into creation.</p>

<p>Today, on my last Rubymonster Monday meet up in Berlin we <a href='https://github.com/rubymonsters/speakerinnen_liste/commit/986468c18e527b06b9c047102c4a0ca5a543f59a'>merged my design to master</a>. It was a nice and rewarding feeling. I will miss this crew, especially now that this project has gained momentum. I am not a person who gets mushy on the sound of the word &#8220;community,&#8221; and even less when it comes to all this feminism bullsh..hmm&#8230; discourse, but RailsGirls really makes a lot of sense.</p>

<ul>
<li>With a liitle bit of cheating, stealing and PS transforming you can figure out how to make a decent logo for free.</li>

<li>Reading books about programing is like reading porno stories, so much work to imagine it all, it is so much better to just to it.</li>

<li>Peer to peer learning is effective maybe 15% of the time, but it is worth every minute you wasted on it.</li>

<li>Git is exactly what it means.</li>
</ul>
