<p>No! Why should I write my own JS code if there are so many nice books to read about it. The suspense just keep me hooked into reading more and more of them. It is a drama and the climax seems to be reachable.</p>

<p><a href='http://eloquentjavascript.net/'>Eloquent JavaScript</a> is the best position about JS I&#8217;ve read so far. Not only because I can read it in polish. I am working my ass off doing (most of) book&#8217;s exercises, but let&#8217;s face it - it is just not right.</p>

<p>Besides I finished my two templates. I am excited about the feedback -I will know it tomorrow.</p>

<p>The disappointing experience was my attempt to figure out how to solve the problem of <a href='https://github.com/bartaz/impress.js/pull/131'>relative step positioning in impress.js</a>. I need to give a try again.</p>

<p>Reading JavaScript code out loud, line by line with someone who is able to correct you and explain things is 100 times more helpful than reading books and repeating theory. John said it was fun to explain impress.js to me. I felt sorry for him all these long hours.</p>

<p>It took longer than expected, but I am kind of proud that I am able to translate this code into words. Still I have a feeling that the path from understanding to writing is long and bumpy.</p>

<p>Today I touched the guts. It was my JavaScript day. I finished up the &#8220;Javascript Enlighment&#8221; book, but with the feeling that I still don&#8217;t know anything, I sat with John to reviews some impress.js JavaScript code.</p>

<p>After 2 hours we found ourselves on the 75th line (out of 800). Guys, this is so difficult! Stuff like &#8216;use strict&#8217;, <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immediately-invoked_function_expression'>IIFE</a>&#8230; OMG! Guys, it is wild.</p>

<p>John is invincible: &#8220;Ok, let&#8217;s skip that, I will ask Bartek,&#8221; I said being beaten by the code. &#8220;No, I also want to to understand&#8221;, his striving for knowledge made us slower, me more nervous and him more proud of his teaching skills.</p>

<p>So here I am - 1500 100 900 tabs open with tutorials and articles about JavaScript and CSS3. I am trying to be attentive - these are my mentor&#8217;s recommendations.</p>

<p>Today, on our first weekly meeting, we set our a tactical plan for this week. The gole is to provide impress.js users with some premade themes. The most challenging part will be to pretend that I understand every single line of the impress.js code.</p>

<p>We also discussed if we should care about your grandfather using IE(10) or not and how can we please him as well. Look at my <a href='https://trello.com/board/impress-js-summer-of-code/51bee39938cdf46401002f4e'>Trello Board</a> to see how it is going.</p>

<li>The book <a href='http://www.amazon.com/dp/1849696489'>&#8216;Building Impressive Presentations with Impress.js&#8217;</a> was surprisingly interesting and informative.</li>

<li>The <a href='https://ep2013.europython.eu/p3/live/'>EuroPython</a> schedule doesn&#8217;t seduce me, but I will give it a try tomorrow.</li>

<p>Building a presentation with impress.js is like Disneyland - it will never be finished. There is always something you can add or correct. But I am done with <a href='http://impressjs.challengepost.com/'>ChallengePost</a>. I don&#8217;t want to hear about Google tax evasion any more. This gradient has burned out my eyes.

<p>We planned, we discussed, and now I know what I don&#8217;t know, much better. We set our goal for the summer project clear and simple: make impress.js easy to use for less tech savvy <code>||</code> lazy people. I&#8217;ll need to boost my CSS3 and JavaScript skills in order to achieve this goal. But the most important thing I learned from my first call with my mentor is that he is exactly the person I need and want to work with. Dedicated and willing to share his knowledge. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to limit my role as a mentor to reviewing the code and setting tasks for you, I am happy to teach you stuff,&#8221; he said. Just perfect.</p>

<p>We are going to use a <a href='https://trello.com/board/impress-js-summer-of-code/51bee39938cdf46401002f4e'>Trello board</a> to manage the chaos. Feel more than welcome to spy on this stuff. Knowing you&#8217;re watching will make me more ambitious even though I probably wouldn&#8217;t survive working any more each day.</p>

<p>I planned to continue on reading my favourite bed story about the omnipotent JavaScript and <a href='http://www.amazon.com/dp/1849696489'>book about impress.js</a>, but I just spent all my time on preparing my presentation testing out animations and sub-step features.</p>

<h3 id='today_i_learned'>Today I Learned:</h3>

<ul>
<li>I discovered a wonderful framework: <a href='http://daneden.me/animate/'>animate.css</a> and a hidden gem, <a href='https://github.com/tehfoo/impress.js'>impress.js - sub-steps</a>, that provides navigation sub-steps for presentations. I am curious what keeps Bartek from merging this code.</li>

<li>jQuery documentation is the least helpful crap I have seen.</li>

<li>Being the owner of popular open source project is like a full time job – judging by the number of discussion and GitHub issues Bartek to responds to.</li>

<p>John saved me (again) and reset all the mess from my computer (pff. machine ;p). He dictated (as dictators do) to use <a href='http://boxen.github.com'>Boxen</a> and Time Machine. Now I can run the Speakerinnen application from localhost. John as my backseat developer is just irreplaceable. Well, he is irreplaceable anyways.</p>

<p>I started my day with <a href='https://github.com/bartaz/impress.js/'>impress.js</a>, having a briliant idea to steal some features I need for my presentation form <a href='http://jmpressjs.github.io/jmpress.js/#/home'>Jmpress.js</a> (the framework based on impress.js). As unfair as it sounds, using libraries doesn&#8217;t make you a developer. After trying and trying I was beaten up and decided to get to JavaScript fundaments. I started reading the book <a href='http://www.javascriptenlightenment.com/'>&#8220;Java Script - Enlightement&#8221;</a>, which was a perfect intro to an afternoon nap. Nonetheless I belive it is the right way to get some front-end power and jump form imitation into creation.</p>

<p>Today, on my last Rubymonster Monday meet up in Berlin we <a href='https://github.com/rubymonsters/speakerinnen_liste/commit/986468c18e527b06b9c047102c4a0ca5a543f59a'>merged my design to master</a>. It was a nice and rewarding feeling. I will miss this crew, especially now that this project has gained momentum. I am not a person who gets mushy on the sound of the word &#8220;community,&#8221; and even less when it comes to all this feminism bullsh..hmm&#8230; discourse, but RailsGirls really makes a lot of sense.</p>

<p>I’ll give you $10 if you can get this application to work on my computer. Additional features like air conditioning highly desirable. You in?</p>

<p>After a productive couple of hours working on implementating my classy design for Speakerinnen Liste with <a href='https://github.com/thatbettina'>Bettina</a> and <a href='https://github.com/zaziemo'>Maren</a> (members of the <a href='https://github.com/rubymonsters'>Ruby Monsters</a> team form Berlin) we apparently had some achievements. Though, if it hadn’t been for John’s help we would have made just a big mess in the code. It’s too bad that when I tried to run the application on my own computer it didn’t work. I&#8217;m having problems with the database.</p>

<p>I had to stop working on design implementation until the problem is resolved. Instead, I put my hands into <a href='https://github.com/bartaz/impress.js/'>impress.js</a> – the open source project I will work on this summer. I&#8217;m working with Bartek, impress.js’ owner, and my coaches - John, Chris, and Tom. To understand what is going on behind the scenes, I read the documentation and went through the jQuery code. My jQuery skills can be compared to my Spanish skills – I understand to a certain extent, but active use is quite miserable. I think I have to focus more on this framework.</p>

<p>Impress.js has a challenge on <a href='http://impressjs.challengepost.com/'>ChallengePost</a>. It is a great opportunity to practice a little before I start the Summer of Code. I am building a presentation about tax evasion while trying to add new features to the framework. I already made some very fancy CSS3 effects, but I guess the art of this challenge is to translate this mess of CSS into jQuery and make using the features universal and simple. I will try hard, but am not too optimistic about my ability to do it at this point. With JavaScript or without – I promise to gift your eyes.</p>

<p>Time to prepare for the Rails Girls Summer of Code. My first task was to create this blog to track my work. It seems like changing my every-day passion into a full-time routine, but as an ex-journalist I&#8217;m looking forward to some exhibitionist pleasure. It&#8217;s most likely a one-sided pleasure, my dear small audience.</p>

<p>Rails Girls Summer of Code starts in two weeks. All the participants are supposed to keep a blog to track progress. I&#8217;ve seen some of them already – beautiful design made in five minutes using popular services. Some people call it effectiveness, but there is such a masochistic pleasure in reinventing the wheel that I can&#8217;t resist. I decided to build my hand-made blog. John believes that the only sensible choice for a developer blog is to use a static website generator. I am under constant static-website propaganda that I started to believe that a good front-end developer does not need to get her hands dirty with PHP and I gave up tha idea of creating a Wordpress theme.</p>

<p><a href='http://middlemanapp.com'>Middleman</a>, the open static website generator made it possible to build all all the blogging infrastructure on my website. I hit a roadblock when I decided to add a <a href='https://github.com/masukomi/kudos'>Kudos</a> feature to my posts. Kudos are definitely too &#8220;osom&#8221; (pol. awesome) to go without. This feature totally made my day, and by made my day I mean it just took all the time. Not only mine, but also John&#8217;s.</p>

<p>jQuery was not enough for building Kudos. We needed a backend to store our Kudos and remember the huge numbers of Kudos you all are going to give me. Since there&#8217;s no way to dyanmically store data on a static website, we had to use something else. <a href='http://parse.com'>Parse</a> to the rescue. After painfully wading through the documentation and trying hundreds of variations of code, we made it. Ok, no-cheating -he made it, I gave up on the back end.</p>

<h3 id='today_i_learned'>Today I Learned:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Looking at someone coding can be more tiring than coding on your own.</li>

<li>Before I show any code to John I have to count and correct my messy code, we will not move forward until it&#8217;s cleaned up.</li>

<li>Learning by watching doesn&#8217;t work, but it sure does speed up your progress.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>To sum up</em>: You&#8217;d better make good use of Kudos - it cost me so much time! Viciously I (we) made it so that you cannot remove your kudo in case you change your mind ;p.</p>
